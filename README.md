# Java CRUD operations using Spring boot üé´

CRUD operations implemented and well decorated as per professional practices having REST API.

## üöÄ Overview

This project implements a CRUD operations backend exposing secure, RESTful endpoints. It demonstrates real-world enterprise techniques, including:

* **Spring Boot** for streamlined application setup
* **Spring MVC** for REST controller routing
* **Dependency Injection** using Spring IoC
* **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** for cross-cutting concerns like logging and audit
* Solid architecture: Controllers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories

---

## üìå Features

* ** CRUD operations for:

  * Users
* Global exception handling with meaningful HTTP responses
* Detailed DTO mapping, separating API models from entity models
* Logging and performance aspects using AOP

---

## üíª Tech Stack

* Java 17+
* Spring Boot
* Spring MVC
* Spring Data JPA (with PostgreSQL Database)
* Gradle build system
* JUnit tests (testing basic assertion i.e., assertThat)

---

## üì• Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17+ installed
* Maven

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imbilalbutt/spring-mvc-CRUD-v1.git
   cd spring-mvc-CRUD-v1
   ```

2. Configure application settings in `application.properties` (or `application.yml`), including:

   * Database connection (default: PostgreSQL)
   * Customizable server port

3. Build and run:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api`.

## üìò API Endpoints

| Resource        | Endpoint                         | Methods                        | Roles           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `Auth`          | `/api/auth/signup`               | `POST` (register new users)    | ‚Äî               |
|                 | `/api/auth/signin`               | `POST` (login & token)         | ‚Äî               |
| `User`          | `/api/users`                     | `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`         | `ADMIN`         |

## üõ° Cross-Cutting & Security

* **AOP Logging** ‚Äî Logs execution times of service methods (TODO)
* **Security Config** ‚Äî Roles, password encoder (TODO)
* **Exception Aspect** ‚Äî Handles and formats exceptions consistently

---

## üîÑ Model ‚ÜîÔ∏è DTO Conversion

Leverages Java Functional interfaces for clean mapping:

```java
Function<User, UserDto> userToDto = user -> new UserDto(...);
Function<UserDto, User> dtoToUser = dto -> new User(...);
```

This approach enhances readability and testability by decoupling conversion logic from controllers and services.

---

## üß™ Testing

* Unit tests: JUnit for services, controllers, and AOP aspects
* Integration tests: Load full context, mock security, validate end-to-end behavior

To run tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

### ‚≠ê Tips for polishing further

1. Add badges for build status, coverage, license.
2. Include example `curl` or Postman requests.
3. Add UML/architecture diagrams or API specs (e.g., Swagger UI screenshots).
4. Include a "Known Issues" or "FAQ" section.
